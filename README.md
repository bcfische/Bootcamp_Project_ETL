ETL Project

For this project, we are interested in habitable (i.e. Earth-like) planets that exist outside our solar system. One source of
information is provided by the Planetary Habitability Laboratory, which maintains the Habitable Exoplanets Catalog. Our idea is
to combine this dataset with one from Kaggle, namely the Exoplanets Database, which is a database of all confirmed exoplanets ever
discovered, from all planet-hunting missions. The goal is to find the exoplanets that exist in both databases and create a new
SQL database. The 'exoplanets_sql.ipynb' file contains the code we used to accomplish this.
